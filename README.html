I'm Anatole, high school student in France. I discovered programming in March 2020, during lockdown: since then, I keep being amazed by its awesome potential and all the great things which can be done with it. The best part is, there's always more to learn!

I want to help in making technology more helpful.

- Pretty decent at `TypeScript` *(Adding 'JavaScript' here feels somewhat redundant)*
- Can get by with `Python`, `C++` (learning as I go)
- Learning `Rust` at a very slow pace
