I'm a high school student in France. I discovered code as I was 13: since then, I keep being amazed by its awesome potential and all the great things which can be done with it. The best part is, there's always more to learn! You can reach me by sending me a DM on Twitter. 📫 **Pronouns:** He/him

### 💻 Me and my code
My first project was a Nodejs Discord bot named Brainjuice. Today, I experiment new stuff, and aim at making [useful things](https://github.com/a2br/netflix-pin-hacker "Yeahhh... useful things..."). I also really enjoy participating to repos I love on GitHub. I'm pretty decent at `JavaScript` and `TypeScript`, and I also know `Python`, I learn it as I need it. I *try* to keep a healthy balance between programmation and school. 🎒

### 😄 Apart from that
I really enjoy climbing! 🧗‍♂️ A lot of people inspire me on the Internet or in my entourage, for their curiosity and eager to learn, which are to me huge qualities. I'm revolted by this massive inaction and the willing of ignorance in the face of climate change --until it becomes some useless [lamestream](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lamestream "Pretty useful word, btw") green-washing idea, of course. 🌍 For the same reason, I'm also vegan. I honestly prefer my planet to the taste of meat, which is easily replaceable. My biggest dream is to help while doing what I like. Kinda vague, I know, but that's what I want.

### 🔭 What I'm currently working on
I'm currently working on a personal project, [Covguard](https://github.com/covguard). 🦠 Long story short, it's a platform for my school that'll allow to track COVID spread by collecting data given by students. 😷 At a personnal level, it allows me to discover and manipulate graph databases, with which I'm not familiar.
