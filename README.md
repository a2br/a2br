I'm a high school student in France. I discovered code as I was 13: since then, I keep being amazed by its awesome potential and all the great things which can be done with it. The best part is, there's always more to learn! I *think* I'm pretty good at `JavaScript` and `TypeScript`, and I also know some `Python`. **Discord:** [`a2br#1937`](https://discord.com/users/257378531934208001)
