I'm a high school student in France. I discovered code as I was 13: since then, I keep being amazed by its awesome potential and all the great things which can be done with it. The best part is, there's always more to learn! **Pronouns:** He/him / **Discord:** `a2b#1937`

I'm pretty decent at `JavaScript` and `TypeScript`, and I also know `Python`.
