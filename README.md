I'm a high school student in France. I discovered code as I was 13: since then, I keep being amazed by its awesome potential and all the great things which can be done with it. The best part is, there's always more to learn! **Pronouns:** He/him / **Discord:** `a2b#1937`

My first programmation project was a Nodejs Discord bot named Brainjuice. Today, I experiment new stuff, and aim at making [useful things](https://github.com/a2br/netflix-pin-hacker "Yeahhh... useful things..."). I also really enjoy contributing to repos I love on GitHub. I'm pretty decent at `JavaScript` and `TypeScript`, and I also know `Python`, I learn it as I need it. I *try* to keep a healthy balance between programmation and school. ðŸŽ’ My biggest dream is to help while doing what I like. Kinda vague, I know, but that's what I want.

### ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on
I'm currently working on a personal project, [Covguard](https://github.com/covguard). ðŸ¦  Long story short, it's a platform for my school that'll allow to track COVID spread by collecting data given by students. ðŸ˜· At a personnal level, it allows me to discover and manipulate graph databases, with which I'm not familiar.
